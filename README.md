# Spatial-Statistics
Most representative of my work nowadays. A set of projects and fun experiments using the fields package for spatial statistics. 

Projects: 
* Project 1: Playing around with conditional normal distributions, and understanding covariance functions and their resulting matrices. 
* Project 2: Testing the accuracy of the fields functions against raw calculations, and simulating a conditional field. 
* Project 3: 
* Project 4: 



Important concepts: Linear Statistics (OLS, GLS, transformations), Multivariate and Conditional Normals, Stochastic Processes, Matrix Decompositions, Circulant Embedding, Spatial prediction with Kriging, Conditional Simulation, Maximum Likelihood theory, Covariance Functions, and Kernels.
