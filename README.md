# Spatial-Statistics
Most representative of my work nowadays. A set of projects and fun experiments using the fields package for spatial statistics. 

Projects: 

* Project 4: This is my favorite, so I put it first. Short, but fun and interesting. I take a spatial ozone measurement dataset from the midwest (ish) and fit a spatial process to it, with the covariance parameters estimated using maximum likelihood. I then use this process to do Kriging (spatial prediction), and perform cross validation to analyze the differences between standard and model based RMSE's.

* Project 1: Playing around with conditional normal distributions, and understanding covariance functions and their resulting matrices. 
* Project 2: Testing the accuracy of the fields prediction (Kriging) functions against raw calculations, and simulating a conditional field. 
* Project 3: Testing the accuracy of the fields MLE for covariance functions against raw calculations, MLE Countour Plots, and some large sample theory. 



Important concepts: Linear Statistics (OLS, GLS, transformations), Multivariate and Conditional Normals, Stochastic Processes, Matrix Decompositions, Circulant Embedding, Spatial prediction with Kriging, Conditional Simulation, Maximum Likelihood theory, Covariance Functions, and Kernels.
